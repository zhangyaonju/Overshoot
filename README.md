## Overshoot drought
This repository hosts the code for identifying overshoot drought using the dynamic linear model (DLM) method. It consists the DLM folder and the analysis folder. Further descriptions on these two folders can be found in their respective readme files.

The detailed description of this method can be found in the Nature Ecology & Evolution paper by Yao ZHANG, Trevor KEENAN, and Sha ZHOU.
